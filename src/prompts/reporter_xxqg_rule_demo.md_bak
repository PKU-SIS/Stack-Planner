# Note:

1. All section titles below must be translated according to the locale={{locale}}.**

2. **Key Citations**
   - List all references at the end in link reference format.
   - Include an empty line between each citation for better readability.
   - Format: `- [Source Title]`
   - Only use filename in citations, don't include any file format(such as .txt, .pdf) in citations.

   *Note: Include this section only if the current writing style requires it.*

3. **Attribution Accuracy (Critical)**
   - **Strictly preserve the correspondence between speakers and their statements**: If a source explicitly states "A said / A stated / A pointed out", the output MUST retain A as the speaker for that content. NEVER attribute it to B or anyone else.
   - Before integrating citations, extract and note the【speaker】and【specific content】for each citation to ensure accurate one-to-one correspondence in the output.
   - If uncertain about the original speaker of a statement, use vague expressions such as "some believe" or "it is argued that" rather than making an incorrect attribution.
